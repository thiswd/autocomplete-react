# Typeahead Autocomplete

## Project Description

This project presents a common feature experienced on most websites, the Typeahead or Autocomplete functionality. This is a UI feature that provides real-time suggestions to users as they type into a search input field. A practical example can be seen on Google Search where suggestions populate as you type.

Our Typeahead feature demonstrates a reactive, user-friendly experience by dynamically fetching and displaying a list of movie suggestions based on user input. As the user types into the search field, requests are sent to the movie database API, and a list of corresponding movie titles are fetched and displayed. To ensure the UI is unobtrusive, the list of suggestions disappears when the input field loses focus.

This project also includes a cache layer which stores previously fetched data, reducing the number of requests to the API and improving the application's performance.

Finally, the application incorporates a feature that allows users to select movies from the suggestion list and add them to a personalized list of selected movies.

## Technologies and Patterns

The project was built using **React** for the frontend. We used **React Query** for data fetching, caching and updating our state, ensuring our UI stays in sync with the server state.

A **debouncing** function is implemented to optimize the search input field. This function delays processing the input until there has been a sufficient pause in typing, reducing the number of API calls.

We also adopted the **Context API** and **custom hooks** to manage global state and logic respectively, keeping our components lean and enhancing reusability of code.

To ensure the reliability of our application, we used **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration testing.

For containerization and ease of deployment, we leveraged **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical and interactive demonstration of the Typeahead or Autocomplete functionality using React. The project underscores the importance of creating efficient, user-friendly interfaces while optimizing performance. The implementation of caching techniques and the use of debouncing functions in the project showcase efficient ways to optimize data fetching from APIs. The project further shows how state management can be effectively handled using the Context API, custom hooks, and React Query. Lastly, the integration of unit and integration testing helps to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the application. The project offers a comprehensive example for developers looking to understand how to implement and optimize a typeahead feature in a React application.
